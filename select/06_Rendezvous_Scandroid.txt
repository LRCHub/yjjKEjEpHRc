Rendezvous

It's you and me, meeting in secrecy
As we confide, forget the world outside!

Anticipating that moment in time!

I'm flowing with an electricity
The night is filled with thoughts of you
As we move closer to each other eagerly
You know I cannot wait to rendezvous!

You know I cannot wait to rendezvous!

It's me and you, planning our rendezvous
As we aspire, consumed by our desire!

Anticipating that moment in time!

I'm flowing with an electricity
The night is filled with thoughts of you
As we move closer to each other eagerly
You know I cannot wait to rendezvous!

Rendezvous!

You know I cannot wait to rendezvous!

Na, na, na, na, na, na!
Na, na, na, na, na, na!
Na, na, na, na, na, na!
Na, na, na, na, na, na!

I'm flowing with an electricity
The night is filled with thoughts of you
As we move closer to each other eagerly
You know I cannot wait to rendezvous!

Rendezvous!

You know I cannot wait to rendezvous!

Na, na, na, na, rendezvous!
Na, na, rendezvous!

You know I cannot wait to rendezvous!

Rendezvous!
