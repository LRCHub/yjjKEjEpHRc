'Kay, I walked in, gun on safety
When she see it, she say,
"Save me" (How?)
Little mama in the club gettin'
crazy (Huh)
And she always weird, I call her wavy
Diamonds on my head,
diamonds on my shoes (Shoes)
I don't want your friend,
girl, I wanted you
(You, ooh, ooh)
I don't play pretend,
bitch, we really through
(Yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' on this bitch
and I got her screwed
(whoa, woo, woo)
Got this bitch sick
like she got the flu, oh
I'ma fuck this bitch,
I fuck her off the shrooms (Yeah), whoa
Yeah, I might be greedy
'cause I wanted two (Oy)
We don't need to say it,
we just read the room, oh
Diamonds on my head,
diamonds on my shoe
Take you back to school,
baby, what it do? Ooh
Everything cool, everything cool
I just wanna move if you down to move
Show me what it do,
baby, what it do?
Diamonds on my head,
diamonds on my shoe
Everything cool at the rendezvous
Let's wait here and read the room
Let's wait here and read the room
Diamonds on my head,
