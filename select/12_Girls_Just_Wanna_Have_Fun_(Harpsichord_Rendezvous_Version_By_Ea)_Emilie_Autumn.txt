I come home in the morning light
My mother says
"When you gonna live your life right?"
Oh, mommy dear
We're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings
In the middle of the night
My doctor yells
"What you gonna do with your life?"
Oh, doctor dear, you know
You're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all we really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have...

Girls, they wanna
Wanna have fun
Girls
Wanna have...

Some boys
Take a beautiful girl
And hide her away
From the rest of the world
I wanna be the one
To walk in the sun
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls, they wanna
They wanna have fun
Girls wanna have
They just want, they just want
They just want, they just want

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Girls, they wanna
They wanna have fun
Girls wanna have

When the working
When the working
When the working day is done
Oh, when the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
They wanna have fun
