And he's mean talking
Bean stalking icy man
My feet are walking over him
My sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
And a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started
When you jumped all on my heart
And now we're lazy, lazy
Ooh, lazy, lazy
In the galaxy of stars
With nothing in the middle
'Cept the planet that we own
And it's playing second fiddle
And we're bogged down in a delta of glee
And my mouth has sprung wide open
We got tickets they were free
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl?
Since the stars predicted something new
Would reconnect our worlds
And now we're lazy, we're lazy
Ooh, lazy, lazy
Can we grow, can we grow
Can we grow out? Whoa
Can we grow, can we grow
Can we grow out? Whoa
Can we grow, can we grow
Can we grow out? Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
And he's mean talking
Bean stalking icy man
My feet are walking over him
Sneakers in his hand
And with a picket for a knife
And a rocket to depart in
My life had barely started
When you jumped all on my h-h-h-heart
